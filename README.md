# Edgy Hub

DIY Edge Hub Project

## Introduction
Have you seen the Splunk Edge Hub device?  It's a self-contained platform for OT data collection.  Unfortunately for mere mortals, it's a "partner-only" product and even if you can get one, it's pretty expensive.

Not to be deterred, I set out to recreate the functionality using commodity components.  This is not strictly speaking a **replacement** for Edge Hub, because it can't (yet) be managed from Splunk itself, but it is a fun thing to play with.

Is it really necessary?  No, I can't say it is

Is it really fun? Absolutely
