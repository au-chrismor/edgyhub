# edgy-container

## Introduction
This is the core services container for the Edgy Hub project.

## Implementation
The settings included are basic, but they get the system going.  You can update "mosquitto.conf" in this directory with any parameters you wish to override from a default installation.

Ideally, set the contents of "passwd" to something meaningful

"build.sh" serves as an example of how to create everything.
